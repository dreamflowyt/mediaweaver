# StreamWeaver - Local Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to get your personal media library up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or newer) installed on your computer. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (the same folder where this file is located).
2.  Run the following command to install all the necessary packages for the application:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Step 2: Add Your Media

1.  Navigate to the `public/media` folder within the project directory.
2.  Copy your video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.webm`) into this `public/media` folder.
3.  (Optional) For subtitles, place your `.vtt` subtitle files in the same folder. Ensure the subtitle file has the exact same name as the video file (e.g., `my-movie.mp4` and `my-movie.vtt`).

## Step 3: Build and Run the Application

1.  After the installation is complete and you've added your media, run the following command to build the application for production:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
2.  Once the build is finished, start the application server with this command:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

## Step 4: Access Your Library

1.  Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
2.  Go to the following address:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

Your media library should now be visible and ready to stream. Enjoy!
