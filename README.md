# StreamWeaver

A Next.js application to browse and stream a personal media library.

## Getting Started

1.  **Place your media:** Add your video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogg`) into the `public/media` directory.
2.  **Run the app:** Start the development server.
3.  **Browse your library:** Open the application in your browser to see your media library. The app will automatically generate titles, descriptions, and thumbnails for your videos on the first load.

To start developing, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.
